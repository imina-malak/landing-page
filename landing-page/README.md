# What the project is

[(Back to top)](#Table-of-contents)
Landing Page with more than four sections and navigation bar.
When we click on a navigation item it scrolls smoothly to appropriate section of the page.
While scrolling through the page, the section that is active in the view will be distinguished.

# Development

[(Back to top)](#Table-of-contents)
build the navigation menu with document Properties and events make it dynamic based on the sections of the page.
Add function to distinguish the section in view by using classList methods to change the CSS being displayed.
Add the function to stop the default event when clicking on the navigation item and add a new event to make the scroll smooth.
